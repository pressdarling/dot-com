# About This Site

I created this website in order to explore new technologies and workflows with a documentation-first approach, allowing me to further my web development skills and processes while sharing the fruits of my curiosity. I hope you have found some part of it useful, interesting, or diversionary. Here's an overview of the key aspects:

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Astro, because after a lifetime pushing around raw HTML and CSS this is the first SSG that seems to do just enough, but no more than needed.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, and as little JS as necessary.
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages

## Development Process

I followed these key principles throughout the development:

1. Responsive design
2. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
3. Performance optimisation
4. Clean, maintainable code

## Key Features

- Theme toggle (Professional/Creative modes)
- [Other key features as you develop them]

## Style Guide

- [add style notes, fonts used, etc.]

## Learnings and Challenges

[Update this section as you progress through development]

This site is a continual work in progress. For more detailed insights into my development process, check out my [blog](/blog).
