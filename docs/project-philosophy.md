# Project Philosophy

This personal portfolio project is guided by the following principles:

1. **Continuous Learning**: This project is a platform for exploring new technologies and best practices in web development. It doesn't promise to achieve them.

2. **Documentation-Driven Development**: Prioritising clear, comprehensive documentation to support the development process and future maintenance. It's as important for one person with multiple priorities in life as it is for an enterprise.

3. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: This website should be accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or devices.

4. **Performance Optimisation**: This website replaces 2KB total of HTML and CSS; this must remain a fast, efficient website that provides a smooth user experience.

5. **Sustainable Development**: Creating maintainable, scalable, modular and reusable code that can evolve with future needs.

6. **Open Source Contribution**: While this is a personal project, it has benefited greatly from the open-source community, and aims to contribute back by sharing knowledge and code where appropriate.

7. **Ethical Web Practices**: Respecting user privacy, minimising environmental impact, and generally prioritising the human over capital; none of these are recipes for success, but they're all necessary for self-actualisation.

These principles guide all aspects of the project, from code structure to feature implementation and testing strategies. It is hoped that they will also result in a portfolio website that not only looks good but works well.
